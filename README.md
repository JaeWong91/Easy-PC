## Milestone Project 4
## E-Commerce Web App - PC, Parts and Equipment

Easy-PC is an e-commerce web application. 
The main target audience of the site include computing enthusiasts, gamers and content creators. A powerful computer is essential for high quality gaming and content creation. An upgrade made to your PC is never a bad thing!

The site offers computer parts such as graphics cards, processors, monitors, keyboards and all sorts of components and peripherals for your computing needs.

There is also a blog where posts are published by staff members/admininstrators, where they will share their thoughts and experiences on fully built PCs or specific components, or just anything computer related. If an article covers a certain component that a reader is looking to purchase, the article will provide a personal insight. The main idea here is to provide the reader a better perspective on the specific product.

Disclaimer(Important): The site contains real life products. Please visit sites mentioned in the credits section if you wish to purchase them.

The live website can be found [here](https://easy-pc-jw.herokuapp.com/).
