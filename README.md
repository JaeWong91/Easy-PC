## Milestone Project 4
## E-Commerce Web App - PC, Parts and Equipment

Easy-PC is an e-commerce web application. 
The main target audience of the site include computing enthusiasts, gamers and content creators. A powerful computer is essential for high quality gaming and content creation. An upgrade made to your PC is never a bad thing!

The site offers computer parts such as graphics cards, processors, monitors, keyboards and all sorts of components and peripherals for your computing needs.

There is also a blog where posts are published by staff members/admininstrators, where they will share their thoughts and experiences on fully built PCs or specific components, or just anything computer related. If an article covers a certain component that a reader is looking to purchase, the article will provide a personal insight. The main idea here is to provide the reader a better perspective on the specific product.

Disclaimer(Important): The site contains real life products. Please visit sites mentioned in the credits section if you wish to purchase them.

The live website can be found [here](https://easy-pc-jw.herokuapp.com/).

# Design

## Colour Scheme

- The colour scheme for the project is Purple, White and Black. The purple theme gives a feeling of gaming desktop, in particular with the trend and use of RGB lighting.
- The headings, main navigation bar and headers are a deep purple colour. Some buttons are black with a purple on hover effect.
- The text was kept as black for easy reading.
 
## Typography

- The font-family used for headings and logo is 'Righteous'. Again this gave a gaming feel to it.
- The general body text fonr used is 'Sans-Serif'. This was chosen due to it's simplicity and readability. This is important especially for purchasing reasons.

![](readme-images/search.PNG)



## Product Detail Page

- In the detail page, to the left, the associated image of the product is displayed. To the right the title, description, product dimensions and weight. Plus/Minus icons are placed either side of Number Input Field to increase and decrease quantity. Two buttons - 'Add to Bag' and 'Keep Shopping' - are placed below the quantity input field. The Keep Shopping button will returns the user to the All product page. The add to bag button will add the item(s) to the cart. A toast message will advise the user that their item is added to the bag. If the total is below Â£75, an additional message will let the user know how much they would need to spend to qualify for free delivery. The bottom of this page will house the reviews, if any are submitted.

- Only registered and valid users are able to write a review for a product. The average rating for each product will be updated everytime a review is added. A user is limited to one review per product where there is a sentence to notify the user has already placed a review.

![](readme-images/product-detail.PNG)

## Bag Page

## Checkout Page

- After the user finalizes their purchase, they can move ahead to do a checkout and make the payment of the purchase. This page is divided into two parts, on the right shows the order summary, on the left shows a form requesting for information about the user. The user must fill in the form on the left before being able to continue the checkout process. There are required fields in the form and this information will be saved to the DB and can be checked in the user profile page if the user has logged in or created an account prior to checkout. The credit card field is linked to STRIPE and the form inherits the stripe validations associated with credit cards. Buttons at the bottom allow the user to go back to the shopping cart and make adjustments to the quantity purchased or move ahead to pay and complete the order. Once the user submits the payment information a purple loading screen appears to show that the payment is being processed.

If you would like make a test purchase, please use the below details:

- Credit Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Expiration Date: 04 / 24
- CVC: 424
- ZIP: 42424

Please note that due to Stripe restrictions, single orders that exceed Â£10,000 are not permitted. Defensive measures on the website is in place to notify if a customer holds items in their shopping bag that exceed this.

![](readme-images/checkout.PNG)

## Checkout Success / Order Confirmation Page

- The order confirmation page lists out the order number and the detail of the purchase along with the subtotal and grandtotal. User can check for their order in the profile page. The user can browse back to the products page by clicking the "Browse more lashes" button below the form. The user will also be sent a confirmation email for reference.

Each blog article on this page are stylised using bootstrap card elements, with their associated header images resized at the top of each card. The title and subheadings are placed under the image, along with the author and date published. There is also a thumbs-up icon where the number in brackets show how many liked the the article has received.

![](readme-images/blog.PNG)


## Article page

- This will show the whole article with the main image above. The text is stylised using django's own integrated 'django-ckeditor'. This will allow the author to format the article as they see fit. There is a like button where only validated users can click. This will add a like and only one like is permissable per user. The button is interactive where as a user can change their mind and dislike the article, where the button will become a thumbs-down. Toast messages will notify the user of their like or dislike.

- The bottom of the article page is the comment section. Any visitor of the site, registered or not, are able to leave a comment.

![](readme-images/article.PNG)

## Custom Error Pages

- For cases where errors occur such as data has been removed and no longer exists, it is possible for a user to access a page which no longer exists. I believe that custom error pages are essential and give a more friendly user experience as errors will always occur.

## Future Features

- User password reset without the use of a reset email request.
- An advanced product category feature such as selection boxes to select what categories they want on screen.
- Home page - A possible carousel to display latest products and latest blog articles.


# Technologies Used

## Languages

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - Used for the overall structure of the website.
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - Used for styling, colouring and layout of the site.
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Used to make the website interactive. This was used for the modal and sliders.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Used for creating functions that handle backend processes such as adding information to the database.


## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Additional styling and adding responsiveness to the website
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) templating language. This is used for generating HTML templates and accessing/processing data sent from the frontend.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - A Javascript library that simplifies manipulation of of the HTML DOM.
- [Github](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) - GitHub is used as a storage space for the project, where it can then be pushed onto Gitpod.
- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - Git allowed version control and also to add, commit to Git and push to GitHub.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAjwkdL6BRAREiwA-kiczJUq8U_iMFrVp1xv8FmLNPGDxIxjk-d9dlu_X88qo79PfI1VkZbcaxoC5-QQAvD_BwE) - The wire frame software used for the initial design of the website.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used to apply the font families.
- [PicResize](https://picresize.com/) - This is used to resize large images down to smaller files.
- [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=) - Used to test the site responsiveness on various screen resolution sizes. This is to ensure the layout is intended as designed.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used to apply icons such as the social media icons.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - The default Django database used in development.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - The production database through Heroku.
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/) - The cloud service for hosting media and static files.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) - This was used for test transactions.

## Testing

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - To ensure there were no syntax errors in the HTML code. The site showed only errors and warnings related to the jinja template syntax. This poses no real errors in the deployed website.
- For CSS, I used W3C CSS [W3C CSS Validator Services](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). No errors found here.
- For Javascript, I used [JShint](https://jshint.com/) to ensure no errors in my code. - The only result showed is the '$' not being defined by JSHint. This caused no errors on the final deployed site.
- [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) - The Python code was run through an online checker to ensure no errors found. The only errors showing are that lines were slightly too long. These caused no errors in production and this would be very time consuming to format.
- [cornflakes-linter(flake8)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kevinglasson.cornflakes-linter) - For the Python code, the cornflakes-linter(flake8) extension is installed in the development environment. This gave a live validation check for the code. There are warnings about lines being too long but having spoke to other developers, the maximum 79 characters per line is rather out-dated where screens were much smaller in previous generations.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/?brand=FHFK&gclid=CjwKCAjww-CGBhALEiwAQzWxOiXnVAU7qEiD9ykUo3VELjaivlvMcpmSTkKLr0vSMqvjnv7nKkY8WxoCED8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) - These two browsers are arguably the most popular. These browsers were used to test the visuals and functionality of the website throughout the development process. Using the developer tools, the range of the resolutions were 350x650 to 2160x1440 which would cover a large variety real world screen devices
- [TEMPMAIL](https://temp-mail.org/en/) - this is used for temporary email addresses when creating/registering an account. Verification of th e account is done where the site will send an email.
- [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) - This website was used to test the site on a huge variety of screen sizes. This was to ensure the responsive design of the webapp.

Further Manual Testing - The documentation can be found [here](readme-images/TESTING-MS4.pdf).
